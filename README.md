### Counting Image Objects with OpenCV and Mask RCNN

**Overview**

This repository presents a Python application dedicated to counting objects within images. It employs two primary approaches:

* **Traditional Computer Vision (OpenCV):** Leverages classical image processing techniques for object detection and counting.
* **Deep Learning (Mask RCNN):** Utilizes a state-of-the-art object detection and instance segmentation model for advanced object counting.

**Project Structure**

* **opencv:** Houses the OpenCV-based implementation, encompassing preprocessing scripts, object detection logic, and visualization functions.
* **mask_rcnn:** Contains the Mask RCNN model, pre-trained weights, configuration files, and training scripts.
* **dataset:** Stores the image dataset used for both methodologies.
* **utils:** Provides utility functions for image loading, data manipulation, and evaluation metrics.

**Getting Started**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dhirajpatra/ObjectCountWithMaskRCNNAndOpenCV
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib keras tensorflow
   ```
3. **Prepare dataset:** Ensure the dataset is organized appropriately within the `dataset` directory. Adhere to the following structure:
   ```
   dataset/
       train/
           image1.jpg
           image2.jpg
           ...
       test/
           image1.jpg
           image2.jpg
           ...
   ```
   Replace `train` and `test` with suitable directory names if different.
4. **Run OpenCV-based counting:**
   ```bash
   python opencv/count_objects.py --image_path path/to/image.jpg
   ```
5. **Run Mask RCNN-based counting:**
   ```bash
   python mask_rcnn/detect_and_count.py --image_path path/to/image.jpg
   ```
